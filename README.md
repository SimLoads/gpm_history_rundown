# Google Play Music History Rundown


1) Go to [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/) and download your Google Play Music history  
2) Navigate to the 'tracks' folder and copy that entire directory name to the 'dir' variable in main.py  
3) Run and enjoy  

When all is said and done you can search for artists and get back a specific track list or just hit enter and recieve a random artist.
